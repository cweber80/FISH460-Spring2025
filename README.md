# Project Synopsis

The  use of antifouling paints on boats has led to the accumulation of toxic compounds, such as copper-based biocides, in coastal marine environments. While effective in preventing biofouling, these paints can be a risk to non-target benthic organisms. This study investigates the physiological effects of the copper-based antifouling paint Trilux® 33 Aerosol (active ingredient: cuprous thiocyanate) on the hairy shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, a model species for the economically important Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister). Crabs were exposed for one week to three concentrations of antifouling paint, using surface area-to-volume ratios (2 cm²/L, 8 cm²/L, and 32 cm²/L) as proxies for environmental exposure. Two stress response metrics were assessed: righting time, a behavioral indicator of motor impairment, and hemolymph lactate levels, a physiological marker of anaerobic stress. Results showed a trend of increased righting time with higher concentrations of antifouling paint, suggesting behavioral impairment. Although differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), the highest concentration (32 cm²/L) approached significance (p = 0.10) and consistently exhibited slower righting times. Unexpectedly, lactate levels decreased significantly in the 8 cm²/L and 32 cm²/L treatments compared to the control (p = 0.01 and p = 0.008, respectively), indicating a potential physiological response that does not align with typical patterns of anaerobic stress. The increased righting times may reflect neurological or muscular disruption, possibly linked to damage to sensory organs such as statocysts or cellular stress responses triggered by copper exposure. Decreased lactate levels, despite behavioral evidence of stress, may result from copper-induced gill damage limiting aerobic function without full reliance on anaerobic metabolism or could reflect metabolic suppression. These findings suggest that even short-term exposure to copper-based antifouling paints can negatively affect crab physiology and behavior. Given the ecological and economic importance of  crustaceans like Dungeness crabs, further research is needed to determine long-term effects,  and assess broader  impacts. This study highlights the importance of reevaluating the ecological safety of antifouling technologies and supports the need for more environmentally sustainable marine coatings.
